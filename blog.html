                    <p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. What?! Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
                    <p>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. You don't believe in the Force, do you? A tremor in the Force. <strong> The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</strong> <em> The Force is strong with this one.</em> I have you now.</p>
                    <h2>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying not to, kid. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</li><li>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly…</li><li>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</h3>
                    <p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I call it luck. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?</li><li>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</li><li>Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</li>

                    <p>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</p>
                    <p>Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. You mean it controls your actions? He is here. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You don't believe in the Force, do you?</p>
                    <p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>
                    <p>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</p>
                    <p>I'm trying not to, kid. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
                    <p>As you wish. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? I call it luck. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</p>
                    <p>What?! As you wish. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</p>
                    <p>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? As you wish. You mean it controls your actions?</p>
                    <p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. You mean it controls your actions? I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
                    <p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… You mean it controls your actions? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</p>
